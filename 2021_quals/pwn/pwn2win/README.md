Hint 1: `find the file "flag" in server`

Hint 2:  `My three boss said if you won 3 games they could transform into flag for you`

Hint 3: `Three bosses said : "Try write-what-where something in stack with format string"`

Hint 4: `if your health is lower 0, you will lose, but even if you lose, it can help you to write-what-where. So just make use of your health.`
